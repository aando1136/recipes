SQUIRRELS IN A CLAY POT

If your local A&P has run out of squirrel this week, just come to my porch and bring your shotgun. There is enough for all!

1 t. ground savory
1 t. dried marjoram
1 t. dried thyme
1 T. coarse salt
Freshly ground pepper
2 squirrels (about 1 lb. each), cut into 8 to 10 pieces each
2 large onions, chopped
3 oz. country ham with some fat, cut into strips
1 T. sweet butter
1/3 C. red wine

Preheat oven to 450 F. Crush herbs together along with coarse salt and add about 8 turns of pepper grinder, then rub pieces of squirrel thoroughly with mixture. [Ewww!] Place onion in the bottom of a pre-soaked 4-quart clay pot, put squirrel pieces on top, and then strew ham strips over. Dot with butter and cover with the clay top. Bake for 1 hour and 40 minutes. Remove and add wine, then bake, covered, for a final 20 minutes. Makes 3 to 4 servings.
